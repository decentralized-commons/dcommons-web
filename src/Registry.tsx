    <h1>
        Why blockchain?
    </h1>
    <p>
        Decentralization is a core tenet of Decentralized Commons and blockchain-based tech is the only practical option
        that enables decentralized organizations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike ordinary SQL/NoSQL/NewSQL databases, public blockchains provide at least some degree of immutability,
        trustlessness and tamper-proof audit trails.

        Building the registry on public blockchain also discourages any future attempts to limit or cripple open API
        access to the registry.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Scaling
    </h1>
    <p>
        There are hundreds of millions of CC-licensed works. No public blockchain is able to handle even a small
        fraction of transactions required by the DC registry. Therefore, possible solutions to scaling will be either
        Level 2 of a public blockchain or a new non-PoW public blockchain.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Single points of failure
    </h1>
    <p>
        Probably the most significant part of the registry design deals with single point of failures. Registry's domain
        and lack of options for decentralized management of such domain is one of these single points of failure.

        If the registry domains goes down, it takes all of the authors' link equity with it.
    </p>
    <h1>Domains</h1>
    <p>
        Domains are a crucial element of the registry architecture. Any domain used by the registry needs to have a
        valid DNS entry to enable search engines to index pages and follow rel="canonical" links.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following redundancy options could be utilized to prevent a single point of failure:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Registry domain in the .com TLD owned by a non-profit organization
            </li>
            <li>
                Individual domains per every creator registered in the registry top level domain, e.g. alice.dcr
                where .dcr stands for decentralized commons registry. TLD is owned by a separate non-profit
                organization.
            </li>
            <li>
                Individual domains owned by the content creator in any TLD. To prevent link rot, registry would enforce
                long term registrations of the domains. Sponsorhips could be offered for domain registration to select
                creators.
            </li>
            <li>
                Round robin attribution to multiple domains operated by multiple organizations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dynamic attribution with data and metadata fetched directly from the decentralized registry.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Every domain under control of stewardship organizations would pass the link equity to the domain owned by an
        author. All stewardship organizations would sync their records with registry URI entries.
    </p>
