        <h4>Decentralized</h4>
        <p>
          Prevents a single point of failure. Based on a public blockchain. Individual registry entries are controlled
          by their creators and private keys.
        </p>

        <h4>Permanent URIs</h4>
        <p>URIs are preserved, link rot is prevented.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Canonical URIs</h4>
        <p>
          Link equity is under direct control of a creator and can always be redirected from the registry URI to a
          creator's URI using the rel="canonical" tag attribute.

      <div>
        <h4>Pseudonymous</h4>
        <p>
          Provides a straightforward path for creators who prefer to publish their works under a pseudonym but would
          like an option to merge their identities in the future.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Open data</h4>
        <p>Registry APIs provide unlimited open access to registry data and offer great developer experience.</p>
