            Link equity transfer using rel="canonical"
        </h1>
        <p>
            There is a standard <a href={"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6596"}>RFC6596</a>, cheap and technically
            simple
            way for any website to redirect link equity by using a canonical link relation.

            Rel="canonical" is supported by Google, Yahoo and Bing.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en"> Google</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://moz.com/blog/rel-canonical"> Moz.com</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_link_element"}>Canonical link element on Wikipedia
                    </a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Implementation of rel="canonical" link tag by platforms for Creative Commons works would immediately restore
            an enormous
            amount of value for CC-licensed authors. Unfortunately, platforms and authors incentives are not aligned and
            it
            would be naive to assume that platforms would release captured link equity.
